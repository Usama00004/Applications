Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Power BI Data Analyst position at your Munich office. With hands-on experience in Power BI development, data modeling, and stakeholder collaboration, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your cross-functional project team.

In my current role at Siemens Healthineers as a Working Student Power BI Data Analyst, I work closely with business stakeholders to translate requirements into actionable dashboards. I have built and optimized several reports using DAX and Power Query, improving report load performance by 40%. This experience has sharpened my ability to identify data anomalies, streamline data models, and conduct thorough user acceptance testing (UAT).

Previously, I held a Junior Data Analyst role at Systems Limited, where I focused on automating ETL pipelines using Python and SQL, and helped shape a data-driven culture across departments. My academic foundation in Computer Science, combined with a current Master’s in Global Software Development at Hochschule Fulda, gives me both a strong technical base and the agility to work in complex international environments.

I am especially excited by your emphasis on continuous learning, variety, and cross-functional collaboration. These values resonate with my approach to data analytics — blending curiosity, adaptability, and precision to deliver meaningful insights.

Fluent in English and proficient in German (B1–B2), I am ready to contribute to your team’s success in both technical and client-facing capacities. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background aligns with your goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.
