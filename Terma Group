Dear Hiring Manager,


I am writing to express my interest in the Data Processing Engineer position supporting EUMETSAT in Darmstadt. With a strong foundation in data engineering, real-time processing, and systems integration, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the mission-critical development and maintenance of ground segment components.

Currently pursuing my Master’s in Global Software Development at Hochschule Fulda, I bring over three years of hands-on experience in data pipeline development, ETL, and operational data systems. At Siemens Healthineers, I have built and optimized scalable data workflows, integrated real-time streaming pipelines using Kafka, and managed data modeling tasks in Snowflake. My experience extends to scripting in Python and Bash, automating workflows, and maintaining software in Linux environments—skills that align closely with the requirements of this role.

I am comfortable working in production environments and contributing to all stages of the software lifecycle, including requirement analysis, test planning, documentation, and formal reviews. Familiarity with version control systems such as Git and GitLab, along with exposure to tools like CMake, makes me confident in contributing to the evolution and stability of complex processing systems.

Beyond the technical skills, I bring an analytical mindset, strong documentation habits, and a proactive, team-oriented approach. I am excited by the prospect of working on high-impact Earth Observation missions such as MTG-I2 or MicroCarb and supporting end-to-end data workflows from Level 0 to Level 2.

Thank you for considering my application. I welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to your team’s success. Please find my CV attached, and feel free to contact me to schedule an interview.
