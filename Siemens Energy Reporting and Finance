Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Working Student position in Finance Digitalization & Reporting. As a Master's student in Global Software Development at Hochschule Fulda with a background in data analytics and digital reporting, I am enthusiastic about contributing to Siemens Gamesa's mission in renewable energy through data-driven financial transformation.

Currently, I work as a Working Student Data Analyst at Siemens Healthineers, where I support data modeling, reporting automation, and system integration using Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Snowflake. This role has strengthened my ability to manage financial and operational datasets, automate dashboards, and collaborate closely with IT teams. My previous experience as a Junior Data Analyst at Systems Limited included building ETL pipelines, improving reporting workflows, and enabling cost-effective decision-making through automation and visualization.

My academic and professional journey has equipped me with strong proficiency in Power BI, Power Query, and Excel, along with a deep understanding of reporting metrics and data modeling. I enjoy building impactful dashboards and streamlining processes to support strategic financial planning. Being fluent in English and certified at German B2.2 level, I feel confident in communicating across multicultural and cross-functional teams.

What particularly excites me about this opportunity is the chance to apply my technical and analytical skills in a company leading the green energy transition. I am eager to support efficiency projects, reporting automation, and digital tool implementation in your finance department, while gaining practical experience in a global environment.

I am available to work 20 hours per week and would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can support your team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
