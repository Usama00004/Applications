Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Junior Data Scientist position within your Auto1.com team. With a strong foundation in data analytics, BI development, and emerging experience in machine learning, I am eager to contribute to your mission of optimizing dealer sales through innovative data science solutions.

In my current role at Siemens Healthineers, I develop Power BI dashboards and build Snowflake-based data models that support Controlling and operational decision-making. I’ve automated reporting pipelines using SQL, Python, and DAX—skills that also translate well into developing and supporting machine learning workflows. My work has enabled teams to access insights in real time, improve data quality, and reduce manual reporting effort.

I’m particularly drawn to AUTO1’s focus on applied machine learning—from dynamic pricing to personalized recommendations. I’ve led and contributed to projects involving sentiment analysis, demand forecasting from weather data, and real-time data pipelines using Python, scikit-learn, Snowflake, and AWS S3. These experiences have sharpened my ability to extract actionable insights from complex datasets and deploy data-driven solutions in production environments.

Currently pursuing a Master’s in Global Software Development at Hochschule Fulda, I bring both technical acumen and cross-functional communication skills to collaborative projects. I’m confident in my ability to grow within a team of talented data scientists and contribute meaningfully to ongoing innovation.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skill set and learning mindset align with AUTO1’s goals. Thank you for considering my application—I look forward to the possibility of joining your international and forward-thinking team.
