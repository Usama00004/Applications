Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Analyst position within your Commercial Analytics team. With over two years of experience in data analysis, business intelligence, and dashboard development, I bring a proven ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive commercial decisions. The opportunity to work in a cross-functional, data-driven environment that empowers sales, lead management, and customer service aligns perfectly with both my technical capabilities and professional goals.

In my current role at Siemens Healthineers, I design and manage Power BI dashboards that provide real-time insights to business stakeholders. I’ve developed scalable data pipelines using Python and SQL, and implemented Snowflake and Kafka-based workflows to ensure efficient and high-quality data integration. These efforts directly support internal commercial and operational teams, enabling them to make informed, data-backed decisions.

Previously at Systems Limited, I collaborated closely with sales and service teams to automate reporting processes and uncover customer behavior trends. I also led a variety of projects involving automated data extraction, preprocessing, and visualization using Power BI—skills that directly align with your requirement for actionable dashboards and process automation.

What excites me most about this role is the collaborative nature of the work—interfacing with both commercial and technical teams to build analytical solutions that have a tangible business impact. I thrive in such environments and am eager to contribute my technical skills and business mindset to support your mission.

I hold certifications in Power BI, Azure, Google Data Analytics, and IBM Datastage, and I am currently advancing my knowledge of German (B2 level). My portfolio of Power BI dashboards and data pipeline projects is available on GitHub and showcases the type of work I look forward to bringing to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and passion for data can add value to your team. I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to hearing from you.
