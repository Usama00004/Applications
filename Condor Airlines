Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the Analytics Engineer position at Condor. With over three years of experience in data analytics and business intelligence, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your data infrastructure and reporting systems.

Currently, I work as a Working Student Data Analyst at Siemens Healthineers, where I support the development of scalable data models using SQL and Snowflake. I also help build semantic layers and centralized KPI definitions for Power BI dashboards used across multiple teams. My responsibilities include data integration, transformation, and performance optimization for large datasets.

In my previous role as a Junior Data Analyst at Systems Limited, I developed automated ETL pipelines using Python and worked on real-time data processing with Kafka. These experiences have given me a strong foundation in both data engineering and analytics.

I have hands-on experience with Power BI (including DAX, semantic modeling, and performance tuning), Azure Data Services, Git, and version-controlled data modeling workflows similar to dbt. I also document metric logic and data flows clearly to ensure accuracy and reusability across reporting use cases.

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Global Software Development at Hochschule Fulda and am available for either full-time or part-time opportunities. I am fluent in English and hold a B1 certification in German.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs.
