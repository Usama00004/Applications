Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Working Student position in Business Intelligence and Analytics at your company. With a strong academic foundation in data analytics, hands-on experience in Power BI, SQL, and Python, and an analytical mindset shaped through real-world BI projects, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your mission of making health and everyday well-being a meaningful lifestyle concept.

Currently, I am pursuing my M.Sc. in Global Software Development at Hochschule Fulda, where I have sharpened my skills in data modeling, dashboard design, and analytical thinking. Alongside my studies, I am working as a Data Analyst at Siemens Healthineers, where I develop dashboards, analyze business metrics, and support cross-functional teams in data-driven decision-making. This role has strengthened my ability to translate raw data into actionable insights, communicate findings to non-technical audiences, and approach problems with precision and curiosity.

Your emphasis on a structured and analytical mindset, strong attention to detail, and fluency in interpreting e-commerce and retail metrics resonates strongly with my experience. I have designed multiple KPI-driven dashboards, automated reporting workflows, and worked extensively with metrics such as sales trends, conversion patterns, customer segmentation, and operational performance. I am also proficient in Excel/Google Sheets and have experience with BI tools such as Power BI and Looker-like environments. My proactive attitude drives me to explore patterns, validate assumptions, and deliver insights that genuinely impact business outcomes.

Beyond technical expertise, what motivates me most is joining an ambitious, mission-driven team like yours—one that values growth, learning, and collaboration. I thrive in environments where curiosity and initiative are encouraged, and I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to innovative health and wellness products backed by scientific research. The culture you describe—young, motivated, and united by a shared purpose—aligns perfectly with the environment in which I do my best work.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your BI and analytics initiatives and support your team in turning complex data into meaningful insights that drive business value. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and enthusiasm align with your needs.
