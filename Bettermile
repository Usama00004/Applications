Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Data Analyst position at Bettermile. Your mission of enabling seamless operations through better data visibility resonates strongly with me, and I am particularly drawn to Bettermile’s culture of autonomy, creativity, and shared learning. With hands-on experience in descriptive analytics, KPI development, Snowflake-based data platforms, and automated ETL pipelines, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your dashboards, data lake, and analytics workflows.

In my current role as a Data Analytics Intern at Bosch, I work on designing and maintaining dashboards, optimizing data refresh cycles, and performing descriptive analysis to uncover trends that guide decision-making across teams. I regularly collaborate with product and engineering stakeholders to define new KPIs and improve data transparency—efforts that have significantly enhanced reporting reliability and reduced manual troubleshooting. My earlier experience at Systems Limited further strengthened my skills in SQL-based ETL pipelines, star-schema modeling, and building business-facing Power BI dashboards used for operational and strategic insights.

I am particularly inspired by the opportunity at Bettermile to contribute to a centralised Snowflake data platform and explore the use of LLMs and Generative AI. These are areas I have already begun integrating into my personal and academic projects, making me eager to apply and expand this knowledge in a production environment. I am also excited about the possibility of participating in the Data Analysis Guild—continuous learning and knowledge-sharing are central to how I like to work.

What stands out most to me about Bettermile is the balance of autonomy and support, the genuinely diverse team environment, and the modern, people-centered workplace. I value collaborative spaces where new ideas are welcomed, and I am motivated by environments that encourage both creativity and ownership—qualities that your job description highlights.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my enthusiasm for data, problem-solving mindset, and technical skills to Bettermile. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and learning from the inspiring people at Bettermile.
