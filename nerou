Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the advertised working student position in the area of Data Science and Machine Learning. Currently pursuing my Master's in Global Software Development at Hochschule Fulda, I bring over three years of hands-on experience in data analytics, a strong foundation in Python, and a deep interest in machine learning and statistical methods.

In my current role as a Working Student Data Analyst at Siemens Healthineers, I build Power BI dashboards connected to Snowflake, enabling data-driven insights for the Controlling and Management teams. I am responsible for data validation, automated data transformation, and KPI development. Previously, as a Junior Analyst at Systems Limited, I automated ETL processes using Python and SQL and provided ad-hoc analytical support across departments.

Beyond business intelligence, I am particularly passionate about applying data science techniques to real-world problems. I have independently built and deployed machine learning pipelines, including a Twitter Sentiment Analysis project involving data scraping, NLP preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Scikit-learn. You can find this and other projects on my GitHub profile.

I am highly organized, able to work independently, and quick to grasp new concepts. With my analytical mindset and practical experience in handling large datasets and applying ML models, I am confident I can add value to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the role further in an interview.

Sincerely,
Usama Tahir
