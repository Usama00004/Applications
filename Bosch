Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in Internship in Data Science / PowerBI position as advertised. With a strong foundation in Data Science, over two years of hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization, and ongoing master’s studies in Global Software Development at Hochschule Fulda, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your data-driven initiatives.

In my current role as a Power BI Data Analyst at Siemens Healthineers, I design and develop scalable dashboards using Power BI to track key performance metrics and enable real-time decision-making. I integrate data from platforms like Snowflake and automate reporting pipelines, combining SQL, DAX, and Power Query to create reliable and insightful data products. This experience, along with my background in Python and MySQL, has equipped me to tackle Big Data challenges and support business intelligence strategies effectively.

I am particularly drawn to your emphasis on autonomy, structure, and collaboration. Throughout my career, I have taken the initiative to build end-to-end data pipelines and streamline ETL processes. At Systems Limited, I independently implemented automated data workflows using Python and Kafka, which significantly reduced reporting latency and manual overhead.

I am fluent in English (C1) and hold a B2.2 certification in German, which enables me to work comfortably in bilingual teams. I take pride in my adaptability, structured approach to problem-solving, and enthusiasm for continuous learning—especially in areas like data modeling, visualization, and cloud technologies.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your team and further develop my skills in a stimulating environment. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can support your data initiatives.
