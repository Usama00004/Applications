Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Working Student (f/m/d) – AI Development position at Siemens Healthineers. As a current Master’s student in Global Software Development at Hochschule Fulda and a working student in Data Analytics at Siemens Healthineers, I am enthusiastic about contributing further to AI development within a company that is shaping the future of healthcare.

In my current role, I work with Power BI, SQL, and Snowflake to build data models and generate actionable insights for business units. My responsibilities also involve automating data pipelines and improving reporting efficiency. Alongside this, I have pursued personal machine learning projects including a COVID-19 Case Severity Classifier, where I used a Kaggle dataset to train and evaluate models to predict patient outcomes. This project demonstrates my practical knowledge of classification algorithms, feature engineering, and explainable AI—aligning well with the expectations of this role.

I bring:

Proficiency in Python, including libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn
Practical experience in data collection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis.
Hands-on exposure to LLMs and prompt engineering, along with a strong interest in improving AI systems through iterative feedback.
A proactive mindset and proven ability to work across teams, backed by strong communication skills in English (C1) and intermediate German (B1-B2).
I am passionate about leveraging AI to drive impactful healthcare solutions and would value the opportunity to support your AI prototyping efforts—whether through data processing, model iteration, or technology research.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team. Thank you for considering my application.
