Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the position of Power BI Consultant / Developer within your Digital & IT Division. With hands-on experience in Power BI, data modeling, and BI governance, combined with a solid background in ETL, SAP integration, and analytics, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your company-wide BI transformation initiatives.
