\section{Projects}  

\textbf{Real Estate Data Pipeline Project:} Built an end-to-end data pipeline to process real estate data from Redfin, showcasing modern data engineering practices (available on \href{https://github.com/Usama00004/StreamAnalysis}{GitHub}). Extracted raw data and stored it in AWS S3 for further processing. The datasets were transformed and cleaned to ensure they were analysis-ready. Used Snowpipe to load the transformed data into Snowflake and connected Snowflake to Power BI to deliver actionable visualizations.




\textbf{Data Analysis Dashboard:} Developed a Power BI dashboard to visualize trends and insights from processed data using Python (Pandas). Reduced data processing time by 20\% through preprocessing and error handling pipelines (available on \href{https://github.com/Usama00004/SalesReport}{GitHub}).  

\textbf{Real Estate Data Pipeline Project:} This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that fetches weather data from an API, processes the data using Python Pandas, and loads the transformed data into a Snowflake table. The data in Snowflake is further used in Power BI to create actionable visualizations and analyses, showcasing end-to-end data engineering practices (available on \href{https://github.com/Usama00004/StreamAnalysis}{GitHub}).

\textbf{Mobile Sales Data Visualization Dashboard:} This project is a data visualization dashboard that provides insights into mobile sales and orders for the years 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. The dashboard helps users explore sales trends, order patterns, and other key metrics to better understand performance over time, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning (available on \href{https://github.com/Usama00004/DAX}{GitHub}).


\textbf{Sentiment Analysis Pipeline:} Automated web scraping and sentiment analysis using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Scikit-learn. Enhanced efficiency by 25\% and reduced manual effort by 40\% through automation (available on \href{https://github.com/Usama00004/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis}{GitHub}).  

\section{Publications}  

\textbf{Hotspot-Aware Workload Scheduling and Server Placement for Heterogeneous Cloud Data Centers:} Published in MDPI Energies Journal, this research proposes algorithms for optimizing resource utilization and minimizing energy consumption in cloud environments (see publication on \href{https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/7/2541}{MDPI Energies}).

Dear Siemens Healthineers Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the International Graduate Program in Information Technology at Siemens Healthineers. Currently, I am part of the Siemens Healthineers family, working in the Data Warehousing domain, where I support business-critical data infrastructure and reporting processes. This experience has deepened my passion for healthcare innovation and strengthened my commitment to advancing within the company.

My background in Computer Science and software engineering, combined with practical experience in data modeling, Power BI, Python-based ETL pipelines, and Snowflake, has prepared me to tackle complex technical challenges and contribute to cross-functional global teams.

Prior to moving to Germany, I worked in Cloud & DevOps roles, managing scalable infrastructure and deploying analytical tools for healthcare and logistics startups. My project AquaMetrics—a Python and Power BI-based solution for wastewater quality monitoring—illustrates how I apply data-driven thinking to real-world health and environmental challenges.

With over a year of international experience in both academic and professional settings, fluency in English, and B1 certification in German (currently enrolled in B2), I am comfortable working in diverse, multicultural teams. I am especially excited about the opportunity to take on an international assignment, broaden my perspective, and contribute to Siemens Healthineers' global impact on patient care and diagnostic excellence.

I view this program as a natural next step in my journey with Siemens Healthineers—allowing me to grow within the organization, take on greater responsibilities, and help shape the future of healthcare through technology.

Thank you for considering my application. I have enclosed my CV and all supporting documents, and I look forward to the opportunity to contribute further to our shared mission.
