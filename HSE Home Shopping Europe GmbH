Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Expert BI & Analytics (m/f/d) position at HSE. With a solid background in business intelligence, data engineering, and analytics, combined with hands-on experience in Power BI, DBT, Snowflake, and Git-based workflows, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your innovative digital teams and help shape the future of live commerce.

In my current and previous roles, I have developed and managed end-to-end BI solutions, starting from raw data extraction, transformation, and loading to delivering insightful dashboards and reports that drive strategic business decisions. I have built scalable ELT pipelines using Snowflake and DBT, designed semantic models and dimensional data structures that optimize query performance, and implemented automated testing to ensure data quality and reliable BI delivery.

My experience includes managing Power BI workspaces, creating deployment pipelines, and applying governance standards to maintain clean, maintainable, and high-performing BI solutions. I am proficient in Git for version control, using branching strategies and collaborative workflows to ensure efficient team collaboration and deployment consistency across BI projects.

Working in agile, cross-functional teams has sharpened my communication skills and strengthened my proactive approach to solving complex data challenges. I am highly motivated to work in a dynamic environment like HSE’s, where innovation meets customer-centric digital commerce.

I am available to work in the office twice a week and possess fluent English language skills for effective business communication. While my German is currently intermediate, I am actively improving it to better support team collaboration.

I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experiences align with HSE’s vision and contribute to your continued success. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team.
