Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Business Data Analyst position at your company. With over two years of experience in data analysis and BI development—including my current role at Siemens Healthineers—I bring a strong background in building intuitive dashboards, transforming raw data into strategic insights, and supporting data-driven decision-making across departments.

At Siemens Healthineers, I work closely with the Controlling and Data Warehouse teams to develop Power BI dashboards that deliver real-time insights to stakeholders. I have designed data models using Snowflake (Star and Snowflake schema) and integrated them into visual reports for finance and operations. My work has helped business users access KPIs and make informed decisions faster. Additionally, I’ve automated reporting workflows using SQL and DAX to improve efficiency and reduce manual overhead.

Beyond technical proficiency, I thrive in collaborative settings and enjoy translating business requirements into impactful data solutions. My academic background in Global Software Development (MSc, Hochschule Fulda) and Computer Science (BSc, COMSATS) has provided me with both analytical and interdisciplinary communication skills. I am also certified in Power BI, Google Data Analytics, and IBM Datastage ETL tools, further supporting my ability to bridge business needs with technical execution.

I am enthusiastic about contributing my skills to a team that values strategic BI development and stakeholder impact. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can support your BI and data-driven transformation initiatives.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further.
