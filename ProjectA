Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Data Engineer position at your Berlin office. With a strong foundation in data engineering and analytics, hands-on experience in building scalable data infrastructure using Python, Snowflake, dbt, and Airflow, and a passion for solving complex business problems with data-driven solutions, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your Data & Analytics team.

In my current role at Siemens Healthineers, I’ve been designing and orchestrating robust ETL pipelines using Snowflake and Airflow, supporting regulatory and business stakeholders through reliable data flows and KPI alignment. I’ve developed dbt models for transparent data transformation, applied CI/CD practices with tools like Harness, and implemented observability measures to ensure pipeline health. Previously, at Systems Limited, I gained experience in data integration, real-time processing using Kafka, and translating analytical needs into scalable architectures.

What excites me about your team’s mission is the combination of cutting-edge technology, the commitment to meaningful impact, and the vision to empower organizations to make objective decisions through data. I’m particularly drawn to the opportunity to work on building data warehouses, recommendation engines, and marketing automation systems — areas where I’ve already demonstrated success in both academic and professional settings.

My technical strengths are complemented by a collaborative mindset and a curiosity-driven approach to learning. I thrive in agile, cross-functional environments and am constantly looking for ways to bridge the gap between data engineering and actionable insights. I am also eligible to work in Germany (currently based in Berlin), and fluent in English with intermediate proficiency in German (B1 certified).

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background aligns with your goals and how I can contribute to your team’s success. I am available at your convenience for an interview.
